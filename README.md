### About me

I am a postdoc in mathematics at the University of Bologna since February 2021. Before, I was a PhD student at the University of Stavanger. Here is [my CV](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/CV_Sep_2023.pdf).

### Research

I am an algebraic geometer interested in the derived categories of Fano and Calabi-Yau varieties, exceptional collections of rational homogeneous varieties, non-abelian gauged linear sigma models and matrix factorization categories. My papers can be found [here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/papers).

### Teaching

[Here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/CV_Jan_2023.pdf) is my past teaching activity.

### Besides algebraic geometry
I'm working with [Hello Human](https://www.hellohuman.it) on machine learning. More precisely, we are working at an LLM approach to recommendation systems. More updates soon!
