### About me

I am a postdoc in mathematics at the University of Bologna since February 2021. Before, I was a PhD student at the University of Stavanger. Here is [my CV](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/CV_Jul_2022.pdf).

### Research

I am an algebraic geometer interested in the derived categories of Fano and Calabi-Yau varieties, exceptional collections of rational homogeneous varieties, non-abelian gauged linear sigma models and matrix factorization categories. My papers can be found [here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/papers).

### Teaching

I am assistant to the course [Geometria e Algebra T](https://virtuale.unibo.it/course/view.php?id=33616) for the bachelor in Chemical Engineering. [Here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/CV_Jul_2022.pdf) is my past teaching activity.

### News

The last fall semester there has been a joint seminar between the universities of Bologna, Chemnitz and Nancy on Bridgeland stability conditions. [Here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/bridgeland) you can find titles, abstracts and videos of the talks.

I am currently collaborating with [Algoretico](https://www.algoretico.it).
