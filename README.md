### About me

I am a postdoc in mathematics at the University of Bologna since February 2021. Before, I was a PhD student at the University of Stavanger. Here is [my CV](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/CV_Nov_2022.pdf).

### Research

I am an algebraic geometer interested in the derived categories of Fano and Calabi-Yau varieties, exceptional collections of rational homogeneous varieties, non-abelian gauged linear sigma models and matrix factorization categories. My papers can be found [here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/papers).
In the spring of 2022 I worked with [Algoretico](https://www.algoretico.it) on a project on computer vision.

### Teaching

[Here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/CV_Nov_2022.pdf) is my past teaching activity.
