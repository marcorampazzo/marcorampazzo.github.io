### About me

I am a postdoc in mathematics at the University of Bologna since February 2021. Before, I was a PhD student at the University of Stavanger. Here is [my CV](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/CV_Oct_2024.pdf).

From March 2025 I will join the University of Antwerp as a postdoc.

### Research

I am an algebraic geometer, mostly interested in derived categories and homogeneous varieties. In particular, I am working on derived categories of Fano and Calabi-Yau varieties, exceptional collections of rational homogeneous varieties, non-abelian gauged linear sigma models and variations of GIT. My papers can be found [here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/papers).

### Teaching

[Here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/CV_Oct_2024.pdf) is my past teaching activity.

### Besides algebraic geometry
I'm collaborating with [Hello Human s.r.l.](https://www.hellohuman.it) on machine learning. More precisely, we are working at an LLM approach to recommendation systems. More updates soon!
