### About me

I am a research fellow (Assegnista di Ricerca) in mathematics at the University of Bologna. Before, I was a PhD student at the University of Stavanger. Here are [my thesis](https://ebooks.uis.no/index.php/USPS/catalog/download/78/77/346-1?inline=1) and [my CV](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/CV_Oct_2021.pdf).

### Research interests

I am an algebraic geometer interested in the derived categories of Fano and Calabi-Yau varieties, exceptional collections of rational homogeneous varieties, non-abelian gauged linear sigma models. My papers can be found [here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/papers).

### Teaching

I am assistant to the course [Geometria e Algebra T](https://virtuale.unibo.it/course/view.php?id=33616) for the bachelor in Chemical Engineering. My past teaching activity can be found [here](https://marcorampazzo.github.io/CV_Oct_2021.pdf).

### Other

1. A [nice overview](https://www.grassmannian.info) of all generalized Grassmannians and their properties
2. A [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcorampazzo/bott-theorem) with a script I use to compute cohomology of irreducible homogeneous vector bundles on generalized flag varieties.
