# Seminar on Bridgeland stability conditions

We are organizing a study seminar with the goal of understanding Bridgeland stability conditions. This is a framework which provided far-reaching results in the theory of moduli spaces and beyond: in the original paper by Bridgeland the space of stability conditions on a given category has been proven to be a (possibly infinite-dimensional) manifold while in further works by Bayer and Macrì the moduli space of stable objects on a K3 surface (with some generality assumptions) has been shown to be projective, and applications to the birational geometry of certain hyperkähler varieties have been found. The main objective of our seminar is to make it all the way to proving the following result:

### Theorem
(cf. [Theorem 1.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4613))
 Let X be a smooth projective K3 surface, and consder v in  H_{alg}^*(X, \mathbb Z)$. Let $\sigma$ be a stability condition on $D^b(X)$, which is generic with respect to $v$. Then the coarse moduli space $M_\sigma(v)$ of $\sigma$-semistable objects with Mukai vector $v$ exists as a normal projective irreducible variety with $\mathbb Q$-factorial singularities.
\end{theorem}

\noindent The present formulation of Bridgeland stability conditions is a well established theory, our plan is to present it with a self-contained series of talks spanning the whole fall semester. No strong background required! We will start with a gentle introduction on triangulated and derived categories and we will cover the necessary information to understand moduli spaces and stacks: contributing with a talk is the perfect way for a PhD student (even a young one!) to get access to new useful skills and to approach a very active field of research, we look forward to hearing from many of you.
