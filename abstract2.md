# The derived category of coherent sheaves

In this second talk, the topic of derived categories will be discussed: the main  focus will be the derived category of coherent sheaves
of a smooth projective variety, and its triangulated structure. Here we will follow Chapters 2 and 3 of [this book](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199296866.001.0001/acprof-9780199296866) as a main source.

1. Construction of the derived category of an abelian  category: category of (bounded) complexes and its shift functor, quasi-isomorphisms, homotopy category, cones, localization. 
2. The category of (quasi-) coherent sheaves of a smooth projective variety. The derived category of coherent sheaves and its triangulated structure.
3. Derived functors, derived homs, pullbacks and pushforwards, cohomology objects.
4. Fourier--Mukai functors
